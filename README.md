This repository contains training neural networks for learning path planning using reinforcement learning, specifically [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html#id1) (DDPG) and its variance [Twin Delayed DDPG](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/td3.html#id1) (TD3).

The inputs to the model are data from the lidar sensors, distance to the target, theta angle and speed and have the speed of the robot as output. The entire environment was carried out in **ROS Noetic** and **Gazebo v11**.

## Getting Started
<a name="Getting-Started"></a>

This repository presents a novel approach to replace the **ROS Navigation Stack (RNS)** with a Deep Reinforcement Learning model for robots equipped with wheels. The goal of this model is to provide a simple and versatile architecture that can be easily integrated into any environment and robot platform. The code is designed to be clean and organized, with all configuration ``config.yaml`` parameters stored in a single config file. Additionally, pre-trained weights are included for immediate use.

This repository was developed using Docker, ensuring compatibility with ROS and adaptability to a wide range of machine configurations, including those running MacOS. The code has been tested and is ready for use, with all necessary commands provided in the accompanying ``Makefile``.

## Environment
<a name="Environment"></a>

The agent's perception of the environment is based on 1D Lidar sensor data, including the robot's orientation relative to the objective, and its angular and linear velocity. The agent must take actions in the form of an angular and linear vector, with both values ranging from -1 to 1.

### Goal and Reward
The purpose of the task is episodic, resetting at each stage of the episode. The agent receives a negative reward penalty of -100 if he collides with an obstacle. On the other hand, if the agent successfully reaches the goal, he will receive a reward of 100. In addition, the agent will also incur a penalty if he walks too close to the walls or if his movement is not smooth.

## Setup
<a name="Setup"></a>

To utilize the environment to your desired specifications, follow these steps to run the agent:

- Configure the environment parameters as needed
- Run the agent using the specified configuration
- Observe and analyze the agent's performance and make adjustments as necessary

  > **Warning** :
  > It is advisable to thoroughly understand the environment, observation, and action space before making any modifications or running the agent.

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir <your_workspace>/src
cd <your_workspace>/src
git clone https://github.com/Nicolasalan/motion.git
```

Build the image Dockerfile:

```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src/motion
make build
```
  > **Warning** :
  > This part can take a while, so be patient and go take another ☕ or 🍫.

***(Optional)*** Install weights for the model:

```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src/motion
make install
```
  > **Note** :
  > The weights will be saved in the checkpoint folder under `src/motion/checkpoints`.

The definition of waypoints is necessary for the correct functioning of the robot in the environment. This includes robot spawn, target, and file saving in `motion/config/`. The ***waypoint_navigation_plugin*** repository (available at [waypoints](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/waypoint_navigation_plugin)) is used to mark the points on the map and create a save file of the positions. Also, it is important to specify the full path in the configuration file.

```yaml
waypoints: '/<your_workspace>/src/motion/config/poses.yaml'
```
## Running the Tests

<a name="Running-the-tests"></a>

To verify that everything is working correctly, run the unit tests.
```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src/motion
make setup # no visualization
```
In the second terminal, start the tests.
```bash
make integration
```

## Usage

<a name="Usage"></a>

Before starting the training, it is important to set up a requirements file for using your mobile robot. This file must specify all the necessary details for the efficient use of the robot.

```yaml
# ==== parameters ros ==== #
topic_cmd: 'cmd_vel'              # topic to publish the velocity
topic_odom: 'odom'                # topic to get the odometry
topic_scan: 'base_scan_front'     # topic to get the laser scan
robot: 'robot'                    # name of the robot in gazebo

# ==== parameters for the environment ==== #
goal_reached_dist: 0.4            # distance to the goal to consider it reached
collision_dist: 0.3               # distance to the obstacle to consider it a collision
orientation_threshold: 0.1        # threshold to consider the orientation reached
environment_dim: 150              # size of the environment
robot_dim: 4                      # x, y, theta, velocity
action_dim: 2                     # angular and linear
time_delta: 0.1                   # 10 Hz
noise_sigma: 0.5                  # noise for the laser scan
```
For training, the robot Hera from the [RoboFEI At Home](https://github.com/robofei-home) team was used, which is intended for domestic use.
  > **Note** :
  > There are a wide variety of parameters in this config.yaml file, but most are defaults. In addition, they are already configured for use by the AWS bookstore world and the Hera robot.

  > **Note** :
  > If necessary, use the Makefile help feature, where all available commands are listed. To use it, run the command `make help`.

## Training Agent

<a name="Training-Agent"></a>

To start the Gazebo sandbox, you need to start the world first and then the robot. Afterwards, you can spawn the target in the world to complete the simulation.
```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src/motion
make spawn
```

To start training:

```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src/motion
make start # or make start-gpu
```

To view agent results

```bash
cd <your_workspace>/src/motion
make tensorboard
```

## Limitations

<a name="Limitations"></a>

The agent has limitations in its navigation capacity, being effective only in static environments and without significant variations. He has difficulty detecting obstacles such as chairs, tables and similar objects, which can affect his efficiency in carrying out tasks. It is necessary to manually define the waypoints on the map so that the agent can move properly.

  > **Note** :
  > This repository also serves as a template for ROS applications, has CI/CD, automated tests and easy configuration templates.
